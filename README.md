# CMD_2048
 command line/terminal based 2048

idea: calibration class: prints a set of numbers, the last number visible should be x (x=10, for example)

or wait... what if x  was user defined, and so was y??
you can size the window as you want, then tell the program the last x and the last y you can see, then the 2048 grid will print in the middle

control the font size
